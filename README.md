The project analyzes housing data, constructing regression models to predict prices. It involves EDA, identifying influential factors, and refining models for accuracy.

The project employs regression diagnostics to analyze housing data from Kaggle, focusing on constructing and refining regression models to understand the factors influencing house prices. Initially, the project involves importing the dataset, which includes 4,600 instances across 18 variables, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify correlations and trends. Two regression models are developed using variables like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, with diagnostics applied to assess model fit, identify outliers, and evaluate linearity and normality. The aim is to refine these models to accurately predict house prices based on a subset of features deemed most influential through correlation analysis and diagnostic testing.

Advanced statistical methods, including checking for multicollinearity and utilizing subset regression techniques, are employed to improve model accuracy. The project demonstrates a methodical approach to regression analysis, starting with a basic model including three continuous variables and progressing to more sophisticated models that consider a wider range of predictors. Outliers are identified and addressed, and the final models are evaluated using metrics like R-squared and RMSE. The project concludes with the selection of the most suitable model using the regsubsets() method, providing insights into the predictive power and reliability of the models developed. This analytical process underscores the importance of rigorous diagnostics in developing robust regression models for real estate data analysis.
